# -DATA-ANALYSIS-USING-COVID-19-PLASMA-BANK-
Major project
The usage of regression model is the basis upon which we lay the foundation of this
project, the data set, the entire refinement of data and the work done on this data in the
later stages will pave a way to create a model, an advanced model, to predict the usage
and need of plasma and the amount of plasma donations over the next couple of years
and this will help in saving lives during these unprecedented times of crises.
The work will be done in a mathematical regression based model and the most important
part will be played by the data collected as the case of plasma therapy is relatively a new
concept in the world of medical science for the treatment of SARS COVID - 19, this will be
quite an excruciating task to perform but it will be a challenging one.
This whole concept of plasma therapy has reinvigorated the entire structure of how
people looked at this certain field of study and with the help of this project , we will also
try to put some light on how this therapy can prove both advantageous and a medical
breakthrough in the coming years.
With the help of a bit of Machine Learning strategies and few mathematical and graphical
modeling techniques, a comprehensive model will be built and displayed to predict the
need of plasma in the near future.
